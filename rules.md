# TOTALLY NOT SUSPICIOUS RULES

TotallyNotSuspicious is a welcoming and friendly community for all players. These rules are expected to be followed by all players with no exceptions. By following these rules we can contribute to a positive environment, making it a fun place to be with friends.

*By joining TotallyNotSuspicious, you will automatically agree to all of the following rules below. Any failure to recognize or keep these rules in mind will result in a punishment in terms of its severity. Please keep in mind that our staff team has extensive knowledge and is completely aware of all rules stated below; the team will not accept any type of excuse for wrongdoings. The following general server and chat rules will apply in _**ANY**_ of our channels, and any member caught showing these behaviors will be punished.*

## Server Information and Terminology
1. Kick: Force-log-off a player from the game. Generally not a punitive measure.
2. Mute: Prevent the player from speaking in public channels and in-game.
3. Temporary Ban: Prevent the player from logging into the server and Discord for a limited time.
4. Ban: Prevent the player from logging into the server and Discord.

## Common Sense

1. Permission Before Forgiveness:
    * In general, you can always ask about a particular rule or activity or topic, but you should first assume that if you have to ask, it is not okay until you have been given the all-clear. The rule of Permission Before Forgiveness does not apply when it comes to our rules.
2. Rules Lawyers:
    * All rules listed here can be debated and picked apart, but anyone with an ounce of common sense knows exactly which side of the line they are on when they are in trouble. If we have to have a debate with you after you’ve been caught breaking rules, we will be much less sympathetic when it is time to mete out punishment.
3. Disagreements:
    * If you have a problem with another player, take it up with them first. If you take your problems up with that person and cannot come to a resolution, talk to an administrator. There are Helpers and Staff (though both are considered “staff”). Start with a Helper and, if one is not available or they cannot help you, ask a Staff member. Do not let your disagreements devolve into arguments in public chat.
4. Why Rules Exist:
   * Remember that rules usually exist because someone screwed it up. If you do not like reading long lists of rules, consider this the next time you decide to break them or argue about them. They exist because players do these things all the time.
5. Problem Solving:
    * Most universal rules within this server are simple and can prevent conflicts. Think ahead of time, rather than endure.

## Public Discourse

1. **Offensive Content, NSFW Content, and Behavior:**

    a. Our community has people from all age groups, locations, and histories. Because of this, many people will have different opinions on various matters and have feelings regarding certain matters that we might not all share. All members of this community are expected to do their absolute best to get along despite our various opinions and feelings.
        - NSFW content and suggestive images are prohibited. 
        - Business code and ethics are updated on a weekly basis all over the world. TNS Staff operates similar to many other large scale Minecraft Servers business structures and guidelines. Many business ethics are universal, not relative.
        - Displaying sexually suggestive objects, pictures, and cartoons are NSFW. Sexually suggestive, lewd, and erotic actions of sex or sexual pleasure are not allowed in any form in the server and or the Discord Server. 
        - If you have to ask "is this NSFW", you are most likely in the wrong. If the Staff team has to argue the issue, you are most likely in the wrong.
        - This rule generally comes down to having common sense. Public content sets a clear standard of expectations. 

    b. Blatantly offensive comments (use of racial slurs, threats, etc) will result in you being banned. Obviously context can matter here, so we will always take into consideration how the comments were made. But we want our community to be clean and friendly, so be warned that if we feel like offensive comments have crossed the line you will be banned.

    c. In general, swearing is okay as long as it isn’t profuse and offensive. However, we strive to be friendly to all, so if someone asks you to stop swearing, please try to get along and help make others feel welcome by not swearing.

    d. These rules apply to usernames as well.

2. **Politics, Religion, and Lifestyle:**
   
    a. Constructive public discourse is always encouraged. We will not shut down *constructive* conversations that stay inoffensive. As with Rule 1.b, context can matter when certain words are used, but TNS is not a debate club.

    b. Hostile arguments, obvious hate, and incitement of others will not be allowed.

    c. Repeated requests to move the conversation outside of TNS will result in being muted for 1 week. Repeated muting punishments will eventually result in you being banned.

3. **Doxxing and Threats:**

    a. While threats also fall under offensive comments, we have made a separate rule regarding doxxing and threats. "Doxxing" refers to publicly disclosing personal information such as the location, appearance and other information of a person with the intent to have them harassed or attacked. Doxxing and making threats will result in all related members being banned and reported.

    b. Any history related to a user will be used in a similar fashion to promote a healthy environment. 

4. **Spamming Chat, Tagging, and Advertisements:**:

    a. All public Discord channels, as well as in-game chat, are monitored for spam. People posting and reposting redundant content, pinging members over and over again, or getting off-topic in the inappropriate channels will be asked to stop or move their conversation to the correct channel. Repeated violations will result in being muted, or banned.

    b. There are a handful of Discord channels that exist for spam chat. These channels are listed under the Miscellaneous category and while rules regarding offensive material still apply, we are much more lenient with regard to spam and content in these channels. If you think you might be posting something off-topic or spammy in public chat, take it to one of these channels.

    c. Advertisements are considered spam. Members advertising for competing Minecraft servers and Discord channels will be removed.

    d. Please report any members who DM you uninvited advertisements. We will never DM you advertisements or invitations. There may be cases where staff allow for the posting of unrelated Discord invitation links, but these must be approved first.

## Public Behavior Policy: Pessimism, Negativity, Harassment, Bullying, Victimization, & Disruption

1. **General Conduct:**
   * This policy is expected to be followed by all players - no exceptions; it is intended to contribute to a positive server environment for everyone.
        - First Occurence: Staff will reach out through DMs to advise on more suitable ways to create more public-appropriate messages. Staff will also ensure the player is reminded of these policies.
        - Second Occurence:  Staff will reach out via DMs based on severity and conflicting public behavior continuing to prompt a conversation about negativity.
        - Third Occurrence: Staff will reach out, their reasoning based on severity, and the Administrators and Moderators will create a group consensus in regards to the member’s status on TNS.
